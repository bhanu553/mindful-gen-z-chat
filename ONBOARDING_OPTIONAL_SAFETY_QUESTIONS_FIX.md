# üîß ONBOARDING SAFETY QUESTIONS - MADE TRULY OPTIONAL ‚úÖ

## **üéØ ISSUE IDENTIFIED & RESOLVED**

### **The Problem:**
In the onboarding form, the safety questions (self-harm thoughts and crisis state) were being marked as "NO" by default instead of being null, and users were forced to select an answer to proceed to the next section.

### **Root Cause:**
The `isValidSection()` function was requiring `formData.self_harm_thoughts !== null && formData.current_crisis !== null` for case 2 (Safety & Crisis Check section), forcing users to make a selection.

## **üîß COMPREHENSIVE FIX IMPLEMENTED**

### **‚úÖ VALIDATION LOGIC FIXED:**
```typescript
case 2:
  // üîß FIXED: Make safety questions truly optional - allow null values
  // Users can proceed without answering these sensitive questions
  return true; // Always allow proceeding from safety section
```

**Before**: Users had to select Yes/No to proceed
**After**: Users can skip these questions entirely

### **‚úÖ VISUAL INDICATORS ADDED:**
- **Question Labels**: Added "(Optional)" to both safety questions
- **Tooltip Text**: Updated to clarify "You can skip this question if you prefer"
- **No Selection Label**: Changed to "No selection (Skip this question)" with gray styling

### **‚úÖ QUESTIONS AFFECTED:**
1. **"Have you ever had thoughts of harming yourself or others?"** - Now truly optional
2. **"Are you currently in a crisis or suicidal state?"** - Now truly optional
